‚úÖ Fix It by Changing DNS to Google or Cloudflare
Here‚Äôs how to change your DNS server to a more reliable one (Google/Cloudflare):

üîß Windows 10/11 DNS Change Steps:
Open Control Panel ‚Üí Go to Network and Sharing Center

Click on Change adapter settings (left menu)

Right-click your active connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) ‚Üí Properties

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) ‚Üí Click Properties

At the bottom, choose:

‚úÖ "Use the following DNS server addresses"

Preferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8

Alternate DNS server: 1.1.1.1

Click OK, then OK again to close all windows

üîÅ Now Flush DNS Cache
After changing DNS, flush the old DNS cache:

cmd
Copy
ipconfig /flushdns
Then test it again:

c
Copy
nslookup meditrackdb.9load8e.mongodb.net
You should now see a successful DNS resolution with IP addresses listed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You Still Can‚Äôt Ping Atlas
Even after fixing DNS, ping will likely still fail because MongoDB Atlas blocks ICMP (ping) requests.

So use your database connection string in your app or mongo shell instead of trying to ping.

Let me know if you want help testing MongoDB connection via Node.js, Python, or Mongo Compass.
